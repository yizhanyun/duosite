# duosite

Duosite (duo: å¤š, many in Simplified Chinese) is a web server on top of fastify that aims to host and run many sub sites, each with its own sub setting, folder structure and template / view engine, and file system based routing  as Nextjs.

## Why duosite?

The reason to develop duosite is simple: I need a web server that allows me experiment old school html / css / js, with each site and setup indepent of each other.

The same goal can be achieved by checkouting out different branches with a different setup. The problem is that then each branch would not be visible to eachother at the same time.

Say I would like to expriment a subsite with ejs template engine and another one with marko engine. I don't want to swith branches. The two should coexist harmony. That's the staring idea of duosite.

## Current goal

The current goal is to provide a convinient environment for expirementing, teaching and studying web technology.

Why it matures, duosite may target production. But that is NOT the goal yet.

## Why choose fastify

Of course because I used it before and liked it.

And its has one cool feature: rewriteUrl that allows duosite to rewrite a request like `my-site-in-ejs.localhost/index.html` to `localhost/my-site-in-ejs/index.html`.

## Development log

This section logs important ideas, design reationale and choices along the development. It is not intended to be complete and well structured but to reflect design ideas and choices down the road.

### Folder structure

duosite

```
 |- server.js : server source code
 |- settings.js : shared settings accross environment
 |- settings.development.js: settings for development only
 |- settings.production.js` : settings for production
 |- src : server source code  folder
    |- utils.js : utils used by server
    |- lang : i18n dictionary
        |- zh-cn : Ssimplified Chinese
        |- en : English
    |- engines : source code for view / template engines
 |- sites : root for sites
    |- www : default site
    |- site1 : sub site
       |- settings.js : shared settings accross environment
       |- settings.development.js: settings for development only
       |- settings.production.js` : settings for production
       |- static : static files such as images, icons etc.
       |- src : source code (html / template etc.)
          |- pages : static html pages or templates subject to each individual engine's interpretation
          |- views / templates / includes / components : source code / templates etc. subject to each individual engine's interpretation
```

### Duosite server settings

Duosite server settings are composed of three files:

```
- `settings.js` : shared settings accross environment
- `settings.development.js`: settings for development only
- `settings.production.js` : settings for production
```

Eventual setting will be a deep merge of `settings.js` and`settings.development.js` in development environment, and  `settings.js` and`settings.production.js` in production environment.

### Subsite setting

Each subsite's settings for renderring each subsite.

Similar to duosite server, it has:

```
- `settings.js` : shared settings accross environment
- `settings.development.js`: settings for development only
- `settings.production.js` : settings for production
```

### Request decoration with subsite resources

When duosite is booted, each subsite's settings, view engines, plugins ( to be designed ) etc. should be initiated and passed down as property `_duosite` of `request` to handlers.

### Boot duosite

Duosite is booted with following steps:

1. load server settings
2. scan sites folder, load site list and site settings
3. initiate view engine and other plugins with site settings
4. enhance `request` with `_duosite` property, which is a object with properties and methods for the subsite's handlers to use.

### `_duosite` object

`request._duosite` has following shape:

```
{
  settings: {...}  // merged subsite settings
  engine: {...} // instantiated engine instance
  ... // TBD along development
}

```

### RewriteUrl

Leveraging fastify's `rewriteUrl` function, http request to `subsite.abc.com/...` is rewritten to `abc.com/subsite/...`
